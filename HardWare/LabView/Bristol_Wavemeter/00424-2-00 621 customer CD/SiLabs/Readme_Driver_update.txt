To install the virtual com port drivers (VCP) you must determine whether your operating system is 32 bit or 64 bit.

This can be done by right-clicking on the "computer" ("my computer") icon and choosing "properties".  The type of operating system will be displayed in the properties window.

For a 32-bit operating system, open the CP210x_VCP_Windows folder and run CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe.

For a 64-bit operating system, open the CP210x_VCP_Windows folder and run CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe.
