# Commenting structure:
## functions:
	- Short blurb on what they do
	- Description of input parameters
	- Description of output parameters
	
## Inside functions:
	- Use descriptive variable names
	- Use consistent indenting, variable naming etc.
	- Organize code by logical blocks
	- Comment lines as necessary (especially if variable name seems ambiguous)
	- Justify hard coded values
	
# Overarching organization:
	- Collect headers for functions into README that is in folder
	- Keep function naming consistent, write caller function to run over multiple
	files to keep versioning reasonable
	- Place files into appropriate folders
